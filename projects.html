                        As a startup company, I voluntarily took the initiative to develop a C# program which reads exported .csv files containing comprehensive data on glass furnace production within our department. Leveraging this stored information, the program accurately determines optimal processing times for furnace loads based on historical data. If a load is delayed beyond the expected output time, the program promptly highlights it, presenting missed load information in text format alongside the total count of missed loads for the production day.
			Additionally, I incorporated a manually configurable delay feature, allowing loads that are missed by a duration shorter than the set delay to not be categorized as missed loads. In a subsequent version, I enhanced the program by integrating a total timer. This feature meticulously tracks the cumulative time lost due to missed loads, providing valuable insights for process optimization.
			Although initially designed as a temporary solution until an official system could be implemented, this program significantly improved efficiency in our production processes.

				In our digital age, keyboards remain a fundamental input device for computer systems. Each keypress generates a unique sound that can be exploited through acoustic side channel attacks, posing significant privacy and security risks. By analyzing these auditory signatures, adversaries can potentially decipher keystrokes, including sensitive information such as passwords and personal data.
			<br><br>
				My research investigates the extent to which keystrokes on a QWERTY layout blue-switch mechanical keyboard can be accurately identified using machine learning techniques. I utilized two different audio recording devices and examined various typing styles from multiple participants to capture a diverse range of auditory signatures. The goal was to assess the vulnerability of keyboard input data against acoustic side channel attacks.
			<br><br>
				Under controlled environmental conditions, the classification algorithms achieved high accuracy in identifying specific letters based on audio signatures. This demonstrates that in ideal conditions, it is possible to accurately decipher keystrokes using the sound they produce. However, in noisy environments, the accuracy significantly dropped, highlighting the challenge of applying these techniques in real-world settings.
			<br><br>
				For instance, a sample from a clean dataset of 20 pangrams achieved 100% accuracy, with an overall average of 88.61%. Conversely, a sample from a noisy dataset peaked at 25% accuracy, with an overall average of 16.27%. These results indicate that while the methods are effective in controlled environments, they are less reliable in practical, everyday scenarios.
			<br><br> 
				While this research demonstrated that keystrokes can be identified with high accuracy in ideal conditions, the performance decreases in more variable, noisy environments. These findings raise important questions and open new avenues for further exploration. More research is needed to determine if audio signatures are consistently unique enough to be exploited in practical side channel attacks. 
			<br><br>
				This work underscores the importance of considering acoustic vulnerabilities in cybersecurity and sets the stage for future studies to enhance the security of keyboard inputs. By understanding these vulnerabilities, we can develop better strategies to protect sensitive information from being compromised through seemingly innocuous means.

				I developed a user-friendly mobile application in Android Studio for a non-profit organization to assist individuals with dementia. The app was designed to address the specific needs of dementia patients and provide support to their caregivers.
			<br><br>
				The app featured customizable medication reminders, allowing users to set specific times and personalized messages for each medication. Detailed information about each medication, including dosage instructions and potential side effects, was readily accessible. Additionally, the app provided tools for creating and managing daily schedules, encompassing activities such as meals, appointments, and exercise routines, with visual and audio cues to aid in comprehension and adherence.
			<br><br>
				A dedicated section for emergency contact information ensured that critical contacts, like family members and healthcare providers, were always easily accessible. The app also included intuitive memory aids such as photo albums and voice recordings. Users could store and categorize photos with annotations to help recall important people and events, and create personal voice recordings for reminders.
			<br><br>
				The development process involved extensive collaboration with healthcare professionals, caregivers, and dementia specialists. This input was essential in ensuring the app was functional and aligned with real-world needs. Through iterative development and continuous feedback, the app was refined to be intuitive and effective, with a simple interface featuring large buttons, clear icons, and high-contrast text to enhance readability.
			<br><br> 
				The primary goal of the app was to enhance the safety, independence, and quality of life for individuals with dementia. By providing reliable medication reminders, structured daily schedules, and easy access to emergency contacts and memory aids, the app aimed to empower users and alleviate some of the stress and anxiety for caregivers. This project represented a significant step forward in leveraging technology to support the dementia community, offering a practical and compassionate solution to their challenges.
